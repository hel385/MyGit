# MyGit (C++)

Like how github keeps tracks of versioning, MyGit simulates this using a linkedlist, constructors, and destructors.

MyGit keeps tracks of all versioning of a single file in the current directory. 

Functionalities include adding to the file, removing a version, loading a specific version, comparing 2 versions, and searching in all versions.

Using constructors and destructors, pesistancy was achieved: whenever the program is terminated, all versions will be saved and reloaded after the program is ran again.
